# ArgumentRecorder

This tool should be able to hook into a running ruby application and passively gather information about project-defined method calls and the parameters that they're receiving in order to generate documentation for each method along with real-world sample values.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'argument_recorder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install argument_recorder

## Usage

```
require 'argument_recorder'

class YourClass
  include ArgumentRecorder
  
  def your_method_definition(param1)
  	# ...
  end
  
  def another_method_definition(keyword_a:, keyword_b: :active)
  	# ...
  end
  
  # This goes at the bottom of your class definition!
  record_arguments
end

YourClass.new.your_method_definition('Awesome!')
YourClass.new.another_method_definition(keyword_a: 'Ben Folds', keyword_b: :very_active)

ArgumentRecorder.display_argument_data
```
